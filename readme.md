## What is it?!
MovieBox was what you could called a "pre-alpha" version of the previously mentioned Vertex. In the final year of the Web Design and Interactive Media program at Humber College, students are tasked with creating a large scale MVP that could be used as a portfolio piece, something that the students are proud of. We had decided to create a personal media player that could be controlled using motion with a Leap Motion.

## Why was it scrapped?!
Well having only 3 months or so to create a fully functioning motion controlled media player is quite a task, while we succedded in making it we learned a coupl of lessons along the way. For starters motion control isn't perfect yet, For someone to use a Leap Motion they would need to have the device right under there hands, which makes controlling it from your couch a bit of a pain.

Secondly the bad end side of the project took up quite a bit of time and we had to take it easy on the styling. It was merely a place holder. We also wanted to use something more than just saving movie information to a JSON file as we had done on this version.
